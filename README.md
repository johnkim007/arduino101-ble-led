Arduino101 BEL LED Project

Arduino 101 adds onboard Bluetooth low energy to enable the Arduino 101 to communicate and interact directly with several devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets without using a Bluetooth low energy shield. With Bluetooth enabled, the Arduino 101 can directly communicate with other devices without additional hardware. Bluetooth low energy is ideal for low-power consumption applications. The sample code for CurieBLE is available at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/CurieBLE.


The nRF Toolbox works with a wide range of the most popular Bluetooth Low Energy accessories.
It contains applications demonstrating BLE profiles: Cycling Speed and Cadence, Running Speed and Cadence, Heart Rate Monitor, Blood Pressure Monitor, Health Thermometer Monitor, Glucose Monitor and Proximity Monitor.

ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort. ASCII was developed a long time ago and now the non-printing characters are rarely used for their original purpose. Below is the ASCII character table and this includes descriptions of the first 32 non-printing characters. ASCII was actually designed for use with teletypes and so the descriptions are somewhat obscure. If someone says they want your CV however in ASCII format, all this means is they want 'plain' text with no formatting such as tabs, bold or underscoring - the raw format that any computer can understand. This is usually so they can easily import the file into their own applications without issues. Notepad.exe creates ASCII text, or in MS Word you can save a file as 'text only'
